## Overview

RedStone Oracle is a decentralized blockchain data provider founded in 2021, with its first production deployment launched in January 2023. The project emerged from Arweave’s incubation program in 2020 and was created to address the limitations of traditional oracles (high cost, slow updates, inflexibility) by using a **modular, cross-chain design**. RedStone’s goal is to deliver **scalable, adaptable, and reliable** data feeds for Web3 applications, enabling developers to access frequently-updated, secure price data across many networks at lower cost. The founding team includes CEO **Jakub Wojciechowski**, COO **Marcin Kaźmierczak**, and Lead Developer **Alex Suvorov**, who combined backgrounds in blockchain engineering and business to build a next-generation oracle network. RedStone has garnered support from major blockchain VCs and leaders (raising \~\$7.5M in 2022 and \$15M in 2024) and is live on dozens of chains, positioning itself as a faster, more customizable alternative to incumbents.

## Technical Design

**Off-Chain Data Collection & Signing:** RedStone employs a network of independent **data providers (oracle nodes)** that aggregate prices from a wide range of sources. Over 150 data sources are integrated, including centralized exchanges (Binance, Coinbase), DEXes (Uniswap, Sushi), and aggregators (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap). Each node fetches raw market data and applies aggregation methods (e.g. median, TWAP) with outlier filtering to compute an accurate price. These nodes then **digitally sign** the price data, attesting to its value and timestamp. Multiple nodes operate in parallel to provide redundancy and security – if one node fails or deviates, others continue to supply correct data. This distributed off-chain collection ensures fresh data is always available without relying on a single provider. After signing, the price updates are broadcast to RedStone’s network for distribution.

&#x20;_Figure: Overview of RedStone's oracle architecture. Off-chain provider nodes gather and sign price data from many sources, then broadcast it through a Data Distribution Layer (e.g. the Streamr network and RedStone gateways) and archive it on Arweave. On-chain, smart contracts retrieve the latest signed data on demand, verify the signatures/timestamps, and use the values for DeFi applications._

**Data Delivery (Push vs Pull Models):** A hallmark of RedStone’s design is that it separates data availability from on-chain delivery, offering flexible consumption models. In the default **Pull (On-Demand)** model, price data is **fetched only when a dApp needs it**, rather than being constantly posted on-chain. RedStone provides developer libraries (contract wrappers) that **inject the latest price data into a user’s transaction call-data** at execution time. The appended data package is then **unpacked and verified on-chain** within the same transaction: the smart contract checks the provider’s signature and timestamp, and can aggregate multiple signed prices (taking a median by default) before using the value. This on-demand approach means _no separate oracle transactions_ are needed – the entire price feed update and usage happens atomically in the user’s interaction, maximizing gas efficiency and speed. In contrast, the **Classic Push** model is also supported for protocols that expect continuously-updating on-chain feeds. In this mode, RedStone runs decentralized relayer nodes to **push price updates to on-chain storage at regular intervals or when certain conditions are met** (e.g. deviation thresholds or heartbeats). The push model uses standard aggregator contracts (e.g. mimicking Chainlink’s interface) so that integrating protocols can read prices from on-chain state if they prefer. Additionally, RedStone introduced an **“X Model”** for advanced DeFi use cases (like perps and options) where front-running must be prevented. The X model uses a two-step transaction: first a user commits an action without a price, then in the next block the price is **pushed on-chain and verified** before finalizing the user’s transaction. This ensures no one can exploit timing differences between price updates and trade execution. All three models (Pull, Push, and X) share the same data backend – RedStone’s signed data packages – giving dApp developers a choice in how data is delivered without changing the source of truth.

**Arweave Data Storage:** A key innovation in RedStone’s architecture is its use of **Arweave** (a permanent decentralized storage chain) as a **data availability layer**. Every signed price update from RedStone’s nodes is not only distributed in real-time, but also **archived on Arweave** in the RedStone Data Distribution Layer. Storing oracle data on Arweave serves multiple purposes: it provides a **tamper-proof, permanent record** of all price feed updates (once data is written to Arweave’s permaweb, it cannot be altered or removed), and it decouples data storage from any single blockchain. This means any blockchain can later retrieve and verify RedStone’s data via Arweave, enabling **cross-chain consistency**. Arweave was chosen for its **cost-efficiency** – instead of paying gas to re-post the same data on many chains, RedStone stores it once on Arweave with a one-time fee, and it remains accessible forever. The permanent storage also enhances transparency: every data point and its origin (which provider signed it, at what time) is logged and can be independently audited. In effect, Arweave acts as a decentralized database where RedStone’s full price history is available for verification and accountability. RedStone’s nodes leverage high-speed Arweave gateways (via the AR.IO infrastructure) to upload new data quickly and fetch it on demand, so using Arweave does not introduce noticeable latency in practice. By offloading bulk data storage off-chain, RedStone can avoid clogging target blockchains with frequent updates while still ensuring data integrity and availability.

## Why Arweave?

RedStone’s reliance on Arweave is driven by the need for a **permanent, secure, and low-cost storage layer** for oracle data. Unlike Ethereum or other L1 chains, where storing large data on-chain is extremely expensive, Arweave is designed for affordable **permanent data storage**. RedStone compresses and packages its price feed data off-chain, then stores it on Arweave at a **fraction of the cost** of on-chain alternatives. This means there are no recurring gas fees to maintain price history – data is stored once and persists indefinitely. The permanence of Arweave ensures that historical price feeds **cannot be tampered with or deleted**; once a price update is written, it’s immutable. This property is crucial for audits and for holding data providers accountable. Every RedStone data provider’s signed updates are recorded on Arweave, creating an **open audit trail** that anyone can verify. In essence, Arweave provides **transparent data availability**: developers and users can query past prices or verify that a given price was indeed signed by the expected provider at a given timestamp. This level of transparency is difficult to achieve with oracles that do not persist their data or that use black-box internal networks. Additionally, because Arweave is blockchain-agnostic, RedStone’s data can be accessed by smart contracts on any chain (via RedStone’s fetching mechanism) without needing a native bridge – the Arweave-backed **data layer acts as a single source of truth** for all networks. The RedStone team explicitly chose Arweave for its **decentralization, permanence, cost-effectiveness and verifiability**, as these features allow RedStone to scale oracle services while maintaining trust. By leveraging Arweave’s “permaweb”, RedStone can offer data feeds that are both **cheaper** (no duplicate on-chain postings) and **more transparent** (historical data always available) than traditional oracle solutions.

## Performance (Latency, Update Frequency, Node Architecture)

**Latency & Update Frequency:** RedStone’s on-demand architecture is optimized for speed. Because data is pulled into transactions only when needed (or pushed under preset conditions), the oracle avoids the delays of scheduled updates. In typical deployments, RedStone achieves **sub-second latency** for price feeds – i.e. dApps get price updates nearly in real time when a user interacts. In fact, the system is capable of extremely high-frequency updates on chains that support fast finality. A recent example is RedStone’s “Bolt” oracle on the MegaETH L2 network, where block times are \~10ms. RedStone Bolt was able to push price updates **every 2.4 milliseconds**, corresponding to over 400 updates per second, to match each new block on MegaETH. This represents an **ultra-low latency** oracle feed – by comparison, a Chainlink ETH/USD feed on Ethereum L1 might update only 40–60 times in a 24-hour period due to network and cost constraints. RedStone demonstrated that its infrastructure can keep up with real-time data streams, delivering fresh prices on a per-block or even sub-block basis. In practice, for most EVM chains, latency is on the order of a couple of seconds or less, since the data is fetched and verified within the same transaction block. The update frequency is effectively on-demand: any time a transaction requires a price (e.g. a user making a trade or a liquidation bot checking collateral), RedStone fetches the latest signed data. This means **the effective update interval is as frequent as the consuming transactions** – the price can update with every new block or user action, rather than waiting for the next oracle push. The push model can be configured with custom heartbeat intervals or deviation triggers, so RedStone can also accommodate high-frequency pushes if a protocol needs continuous updates. Overall, the system’s design minimizes delay between off-chain price changes and on-chain availability. Tests and deployments have shown RedStone can handle high throughput (tens of thousands of price updates per minute) on modern chains, ensuring that even fast-moving markets (like volatile crypto prices or real-time derivatives) can be served accurately by the oracle.

**Node Architecture & Scalability:** RedStone’s backend is built as a **modular, distributed network of nodes** rather than a monolithic oracle. This architecture separates the concerns of data sourcing and data delivery. RedStone data provider nodes run off-chain and each pulls from many data sources; importantly, **the same set of node operators can serve multiple blockchains at once**. Unlike Chainlink, which traditionally requires deploying oracle nodes on each chain and writing feeds to each one, RedStone’s nodes post data to the Arweave-based layer and _any_ supported chain can retrieve from that layer. This means onboarding a new chain does **not** require spinning up a whole new oracle cluster – RedStone can quickly extend support to a new L1 or L2 using the existing data pipeline. This design has allowed RedStone to rapidly expand to **70+ blockchains** (including EVM and non-EVM like StarkNet, Fuel, TON) with consistent reliability. In terms of decentralization, RedStone uses multiple independent node operators (often run by trusted data providers or stakeholders). Each price feed update is **signed by several distinct nodes**, not just one source. On-chain, RedStone’s consumer contracts enforce that a minimum number of unique signers are present and then aggregate the values (by default taking the median) to produce the final price. This on-chain aggregation is optimized at the assembly level for gas efficiency, so even combining many signatures is cost-effective. The multi-signer approach ensures no single node’s outlier can manipulate the price significantly – a few faulty or lagging providers will be outvoted by the honest majority. RedStone has **never suffered a mispricing incident** since inception, which it attributes to this multi-layer validation (off-chain filtering + on-chain consensus) and rigorous monitoring. The oracle nodes are also geographically distributed and have failover mechanisms, so the network is resilient to outages. Finally, RedStone is embracing new forms of decentralization via “restaking” – its upcoming \$RED token economy (not detailed here) is designed to incentivize third-party node operators to stake collateral (e.g. via EigenLayer) and participate in data provision, further bolstering the network’s trust model. In summary, RedStone’s node architecture enables **high throughput and easy multi-chain scaling**, while its combination of independent signers and on-chain verification provides strong security and decentralization guarantees comparable to or exceeding other oracles.

## Use Cases

RedStone’s oracle feeds are being used by a growing list of DeFi protocols and blockchain applications, often enabling new use cases that benefit from its custom data and efficiency. A few notable examples include:

- **Pendle Finance:** Pendle is a yield trading protocol that tokenizes and lets users trade future yield. Pendle integrated RedStone oracles to obtain price data for yield-bearing assets, particularly Liquid Staking Tokens. In early 2024, Pendle announced RedStone as its provider for the price feed of Ether.fi’s **\$weETH** (a wrapped staked ETH token) on Arbitrum. This was a non-standard asset that required a reliable price feed across chains. By using RedStone’s modular oracle, Pendle was able to **quickly support \$weETH on Arbitrum** with a custom feed. Pendle’s CEO praised RedStone’s team for creating **customized oracles for unique use cases** (like restaked ETH derivatives) and for being highly responsive in supporting Pendle’s cross-chain expansion. The result has been a secure and fast-updating price reference for Pendle’s yield markets, contributing to the protocol’s growth (Pendle’s TVL grew dramatically after adding these new markets). This showcases RedStone’s ability to deliver niche data (LST prices, etc.) that others might not provide, and to do so with low latency on demand.

- **Venus Protocol:** Venus is a large money market on BNB Chain (similar to Compound) that relies on oracle prices for loan collateralization. After a notable incident where a Chainlink oracle lag contributed to a \$11M loss on Venus (during the Terra meltdown), the Venus team sought to harden their price feed system. They implemented a **“resilient oracle” setup** that compares two independent oracle sources for each asset. RedStone was brought in as a key part of this solution. Starting in mid-2023, Venus integrated RedStone alongside Chainlink for several major assets. In fact, for some markets (like BTC and BNB prices on BNB Chain), **RedStone became the primary oracle feed** by 2024. RedStone’s data is used as either a check against Chainlink or as the source itself if conditions require. Venus’s CEO noted that _“only with the support of RedStone was Venus able to pioneer \[this] resilient oracle”_ that adds an extra layer of security to DeFi markets. Today Venus uses RedStone feeds for multiple tokens (including its governance token XVS and various LSD tokens like weETH, ezETH, etc.), covering over \$1 billion of assets on the platform. This use case highlights RedStone’s reliability in a high-stakes lending environment, and the benefit of **combining oracles** for safety – RedStone provides a readily available alternative when other feeds fail or pause.

- **Ethena (USDe Stablecoin):** Ethena is a protocol that issues a crypto-collateralized stablecoin called USDe. Maintaining a stable \$1 value for USDe requires robust price feeds for the underlying collateral and hedging instruments. Ethena integrated RedStone oracles to obtain real-time pricing for its on-chain hedging mechanism and to validate the prices used in every mint/redeem of USDe. In practice, Ethena uses a blend of data sources (including CeFi exchange prices, Pyth Network, and RedStone) to ensure its system has multiple reference points for each asset’s price. RedStone became a partner to Ethena in early 2024, when the protocol had around \$200M TVL, and helped them expand to new chains as they grew. By March 2024, Ethena officially integrated RedStone for its price feeds when launching USDe, which at the time had a TVL of \$770M. As of mid-2024, Ethena’s TVL exceeded \$3.4B and RedStone continues to play a critical role in securing its collateral valuations. This case underscores RedStone’s strength in **real-time, multi-source price verification** – Ethena can cross-verify internal pricing with RedStone’s external feed before processing every stablecoin mint/redeem, greatly reducing risk. The integration also speaks to RedStone’s cross-chain capability, as Ethena expanded USDe across multiple networks with RedStone supporting each one.

- **Other Integrations:** RedStone is trusted by over 100 applications across various sectors. For example, **Morpho DAO** (a lending optimizer on Ethereum) uses RedStone for interest rate and asset feeds to enhance lending pool efficiency. **Swell Network** (LSD provider), **Fluidity**, **Spark Protocol**, **Compound v3**, **Frax Finance**, and others have also either integrated or tested RedStone oracles. On newer chains and rollups, RedStone is often the first oracle solution: it powers price feeds on the **Radix** DeFi ecosystem, provides oracles on **zkSync and StarkNet**, and even on non-EVM chains like **TON**. The flexibility to deliver data in different formats (push/pull) and the ability to add **custom data feeds** (e.g. indexes, yield rates, NFT floor prices, etc.) have made RedStone attractive for emerging use cases. For instance, RedStone’s feeds are used in **Proof-of-Reserve** setups for tokenized real-world assets (e.g. by Securitize’s tokenized funds), and RedStone’s developers have pioneered new oracle standards like **ERC-7412** (a hybrid push+pull model for multi-call transactions). These real-world deployments demonstrate how RedStone’s oracle infrastructure is being applied in practice – often enabling **finer-grained data, faster updates, or cross-chain features** that traditional oracles struggle to provide.

## Comparison with Chainlink and Pyth

**Cost Efficiency:** RedStone was designed to be more gas-efficient than legacy oracle networks. By keeping data off-chain until needed, RedStone **avoids the constant on-chain transactions** that networks like Chainlink use to push updates. This yields substantial cost savings – **up to 90% reduction in gas fees** for oracle data delivery, as RedStone only injects data when a transaction occurs instead of posting every few minutes regardless of use. In practical terms, a protocol using RedStone doesn’t pay for redundant updates on every block; it pays only for the inclusion of data when executing its own transactions. Chainlink’s traditional model (push) incurs high costs because a network of nodes must regularly write price data to each blockchain (e.g. updating dozens of feeds across Ethereum and multiple L2s, each with their own gas fees). Pyth’s model is somewhat more cost-efficient than Chainlink on target chains – Pyth publishes data to its own high-speed Solana-based chain and users pull the data on request – which reduces on-chain usage on the destination chain. However, Pyth’s approach still requires an external network (Pyth Net) and bridge transactions to deliver data. \*\*RedStone’s approach keeps costs low by using Arweave for bulk data storage and only **retrieving data on-demand**. This means even for high-frequency data, RedStone scales better cost-wise: e.g. delivering 400 updates/sec on MegaETH was feasible because the marginal cost of each on-chain update was low on that network, and other chains only incur updates when necessary. In summary, compared to Chainlink (which can be expensive for long-tail feeds or frequent updates) and Pyth (which offloads costs to its own chain), RedStone offers **lower and more flexible cost** profiles for dApps. Developers have fine control over update triggers (in pull mode) or can rely on RedStone’s relayers to optimize on-chain posts (in push mode), ensuring no gas is wasted on unused updates.

**Decentralization:** All three oracle networks utilize multiple data sources, but their trust models differ. **Chainlink** operates a _federated network_ of professional node operators (often 20+ nodes) for each feed. These nodes pull data from various sources and post an aggregated value (often the median) on-chain. While Chainlink’s model is decentralized at the node level, the set of node operators is curated by Chainlink Labs and the data aggregation happens off-chain (you only see the final value on-chain). **Pyth Network**, on the other hand, relies on \~70 data publishers (including major exchanges and trading firms) that push price updates to the Pyth on-chain program (originally on Solana). Pyth’s publishers each sign their prices, and a publisher quorum’s aggregate is published for others to pull. This is decentralized in terms of sources, but the governance of the network (choosing publishers, etc.) is more centralized (Pyth Association). **RedStone** takes a hybrid approach: it has **independent node operators signing data**, and enforces consensus _on-chain_ for every data query. When a RedStone feed is used, the consuming smart contract will verify signatures from multiple distinct providers and by default use a median aggregation. This means the end-user can always inspect which providers (identified by public key) contributed to the price, and no single provider can unilaterally dictate the feed. RedStone’s node operator set today is run by the RedStone team and a number of partnered data providers (trusted companies allowed to send data to RedStone’s gateways). This is expanding with community nodes as the project introduces staking for oracle nodes. In terms of **permissionlessness**, Chainlink’s network is closed (only approved nodes), Pyth’s is semi-closed (selected publishers), and RedStone is moving toward a more open model where any qualified provider can join by staking and meeting performance criteria. Notably, RedStone’s **modular architecture** makes it easy to add or replace data sources without disrupting dApps – a protocol can even choose which data providers it trusts from RedStone’s network and **customize the feed** aggregation for their purposes. In summary, **decentralization** in Chainlink/Pyth vs. RedStone is implemented differently: Chainlink/Pyth rely on well-known entities pushing data (with off-chain trust in their correctness), whereas RedStone emphasizes on-chain verification and gives dApps transparency and choice over providers. RedStone’s approach yields a high level of decentralization in the data validation process (if not yet in pure number of node operators, which is growing). As evidence of its security, RedStone has operated with **zero oracle failures or exploits** to date, securing billions in value with multiple independent signers.

**Token Coverage (Data Feed Variety):** One of RedStone’s competitive advantages is the **breadth of its data feeds**. Chainlink historically focused on major asset pairs (ETH, BTC, large-cap tokens, some FX rates, etc.) and currently offers a few hundred feeds across different chains. Pyth also provides many crypto asset prices and some US equity prices, but its catalog is limited to assets that its institutional publishers specialize in. **RedStone supports an _extensive array of data feeds – over 1,000 assets_ as of 2023**, including not only all the popular crypto tokens but also many “long-tail” tokens and novel data types that other oracles don’t cover. For example, RedStone offers price feeds for **LP tokens**, **yield-bearing tokens**, and **liquid staking tokens (LSTs)** (e.g. staked ETH variants) which are often not available via Chainlink. It also provides **ecosystem-specific tokens** (even on smaller chains), indices like DeFi baskets, commodity and forex data via APIs, and **real-world data feeds** (for instance, stocks or commodities in certain contexts) as custom offerings. This wide coverage is enabled by RedStone’s flexible data pipeline – if there is an API or data source for an asset, RedStone can onboard it and serve it to any chain. In contrast, adding a new feed in Chainlink requires node operators’ support and sufficient economic incentive (which is why niche tokens may not get a Chainlink feed). Pyth is expanding coverage but is still selective, often requiring collaborations with data providers. **RedStone’s modular design and storage layer allow it to aggregate any number of feeds without clogging on-chain resources**, so they have been proactive in adding feeds for DeFi innovations (e.g. **LST-related rates, restaking tokens, stablecoin indices**, etc.). In practice, RedStone claims to offer the **most data feeds in the industry** among decentralized oracles. This is beneficial to developers because a dApp can get all its required price points (even obscure ones) from a single oracle provider. For example, if a DeFi app wants the price of a specific liquidity pool token or an interest rate curve, RedStone can provide it, whereas competitors might not have that data readily available. This **comprehensive token coverage** makes RedStone particularly attractive for projects building on emerging assets or complex derivatives that need more than just the top 20 crypto prices.

**Transparency:** In terms of transparency, RedStone is arguably the most transparent among the three. All RedStone price data comes with cryptographic proofs that are verified on-chain, and importantly, RedStone provides **full visibility into data origins**. Developers integrating RedStone can know exactly which sources (exchanges, APIs) and which node operators contributed to a price, because the data package includes that info and it’s logged on Arweave permanently. RedStone’s philosophy is that oracle feeds should not be a “black box” – the consuming protocol and its users should be able to audit how a price was determined. By contrast, **Chainlink** provides an on-chain contract for each feed that shows the current price and some metadata, but the inner workings (which exchanges were polled, what each node reported, etc.) are not easily accessible in real-time to end users. One has to trust Chainlink’s nodes and rely on occasional reports for those details. This opacity has led to Chainlink being described as a black box by the RedStone team. **Pyth** offers transparency within its own network (each publisher’s contributions are signed and can be queried in Pyth’s data logs), but from an Ethereum dApp’s perspective, Pyth’s price comes via an aggregate on a special contract, so the dApp mostly sees a single “Pyth price” unless they dig into off-chain Pyth data. RedStone improves on this by making the **entire price history and sources permanently available on-chain (via Arweave)**. For example, if an anomalous price appears, anyone can look up the Arweave-stored data package to see which provider posted a wrong value. This creates strong **accountability** for data providers – any misbehavior is recorded immutably. Furthermore, RedStone’s transparency extends to letting protocols **choose their data sources**. If a dApp only trusts specific exchanges or wants to exclude certain data providers, RedStone can accommodate that, essentially allowing a **custom oracle with known inputs**. Neither Chainlink nor Pyth offers this level of customization or clarity in their standard feeds. In summary, RedStone leads in transparency by **verifying all data on-chain and leveraging permanent storage for auditability**, whereas Chainlink and Pyth, while decentralized, require more trust in their processes. This transparent design helps build investor and developer confidence, since one can independently verify that, for instance, “Price X at time Y came from the median of providers A, B, C, and all those records are on Arweave”. RedStone’s commitment to openness is a core differentiator in the oracle space, aligning with the ethos of trustless verification in blockchain applications.

Overall, **RedStone vs. Chainlink vs. Pyth** can be summarized as follows: RedStone offers a **modular, on-demand oracle** with broad coverage and low costs, emphasizing on-chain verification and transparency. Chainlink provides a **widely-adopted push oracle** with a long track record but at higher cost and with less flexibility in data sources. Pyth delivers **high-speed prices via a specialized network**, but is more limited to certain ecosystems and relies on off-chain governance. For developers and product managers, RedStone represents an **innovative alternative** that can plug into any EVM or non-EVM chain, supply custom price feeds (even exotic ones), and do so with fine-grained security controls. For investors, RedStone’s approach addresses the pain points of existing oracles (cost, speed, transparency) and positions it as a strong competitor in an oracle market that has historically been dominated by Chainlink. Each project has its merits, but RedStone’s **mix of push/pull models, permanent data layer, and customization** is carving out a unique niche in the oracle landscape, particularly as DeFi expands to new chains and demands more from data infrastructure.
